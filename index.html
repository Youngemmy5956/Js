<!-- This program loops through the numbers 1 to 100 using a for loop. For each number, it checks whether it is divisible by 3, by 5, or by both. Depending on the result of this check, the program either prints "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself using console.log.

The first condition checks whether the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, and prints "FizzBuzz" if it is. The second condition checks whether the number is divisible by only 3, and prints "Fizz" if it is. The third condition checks whether the number is divisible by only 5, and prints "Buzz" if it is. Finally, the else block handles the case where the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, and prints the number itself using console.log.

With this program, you should see the following output in the console: -->

    <script src="json.js"></script>
